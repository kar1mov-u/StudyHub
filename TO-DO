When a user uploads a file we have to send it to S3 and create the hash. If hash is already in our system, no need to send to S3.
Problem: when recieving file, it will be the form of io.Reader(stream). If we want to first check hash, then upload. we cant work with the stream 

Check if hash exists:
    if YES:
        [storage] delete from the s3 
        [repo].  create just ownership, and week info 
    if NO:
        [storage] do not do anything
        [repo] create the resource in the dp
        [repo] create ownership of user, and week
